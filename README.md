# Bioinformatics: Bimm143

This is my work for [BIMM143 Fall 2019](https://bioboot.github.io/bimm143_F19/) at UC San Diego, it mostly includes R programs for biological data analysis.
This class is a bioinformatics lab class. 

Lab09: Performing PCA on breat-cancer data to understand patterns in the dataset that could help classify data to make predictions on diagnosis. 

class12: Use AutoDock Tools to visulaize protein and ligand structure to perform protein-ligand docking. 

class14: Perform differential expression analysis on Rna-Seq data using DESeq2.
