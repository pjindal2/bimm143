## Bimm143 Projects

This is my work for [BIMM143 Fall 2019](https://bioboot.github.io/bimm143_F19/) at UC San Diego, it mostly includes R programs for biological data analysis.
This class is a bioinformatics lab class.

> Lab09: [PCA analysis](https://github.com/pjindal2/bimm143/blob/master/lab09/class09.md)
    Performing PCA on breat-cancer data to understand patterns in the dataset that could help classify data to make             predictions on diagnosis. 

> class12: [Drug Discovery & Design](https://github.com/pjindal2/bimm143/blob/master/class12/class12.md)
    Use AutoDock Tools to visulaize protein and ligand structure to perform protein-ligand docking. 

> class14: [RNA-Seq Data Analysis](https://github.com/pjindal2/bimm143/blob/master/class14/class14work.md)
    Perform differential expression analysis on Rna-Seq data using DESeq2.
